Graph Representation

1. Adjacency List
    each node stores its neighbors
    efficient for sparse graphs

2. Adjacency Matrix:
     Uses a 2D array Where matrix[i][j] = 1 if an edge exists
     efficient for dense graphs

BFS
1. Start from a source node
2. visit all immediate neighbors
3. move to the next level and repeat
- Uses a Queue (FIFO)
- Best for : Shortest path problems, Finding Nearest Neighbor
