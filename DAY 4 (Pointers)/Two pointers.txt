The 2 pointer technique involves using two pointers to iterate through a data structure like an array or lined list.
The key property is that the pointers move through the data structure in tandem, enabling us to compare or correlate
the elements they point to.

Common 2 pointer patterns:

collision pointers
forward / parallel pointers
fast and slow pointers
fixed distance pointers(Sliding Window)
