Sliding Window:
sliding window is a technique used for iterating through a finite test case, typically an array or strings
in a specific and controlled way
it involves creating a window which is a subset of the data that slides through the
larger data set typically one element at a time m while performing a specific operation
 on each subset of the data

this technique is commonly used in algos like finding sub arrays a with specific sum, finding the longest substring with unique chars ,
or solving problems that require a fixed size window to process elements efficiently

2 types of sliding window

1. fixed size sliding window
 find the size of the window -K
 compute the result for 1st window, include the first k elements of the data Struct
 the use a loop to slide the window by 1 and keep computing the result window by window

2. Variable Size sliding window:
