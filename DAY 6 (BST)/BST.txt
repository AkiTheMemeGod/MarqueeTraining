A binary Search Tree is a DS used in CSE for organizing data in a sorted manner. Each node in a BST has at most 2 children,
a left child and a right child, with the left child containing values less than the parent node and the right child containing values greater
than the parent node and the right child containing values greate than the parent node. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient
searching, insertion and deletion operations on the data stored in the tree.
